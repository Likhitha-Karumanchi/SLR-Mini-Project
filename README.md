# SLR-Mini-Project
Likes on FB Post have been a subject of attraction amongst users. The users wanna know who all have liked, loved, wowed their post. These emotions added apart from like-button makes your post super interactive in nature. If you are interested in exploring patterns on the likes on fb, go &amp; mine the patterns from data for interesting user behavior. We have built Regression Models, Checked Assumptions &amp; kept a tab on Overfitting/Underfitting too apart from having fun in finding the patterns.
